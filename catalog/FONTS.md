## Primary Font: Roboto

This is the typeface we use at MonPlan. Please try to avoid using an

```type

}
```

This font is used with any bodies of text or information that relate to Monash University specifically, for example in disclaimers and notices of the footer. This is to abide by their own branding guidelines.

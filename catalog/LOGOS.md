# Logos

Use of the monPlan Brand, monPlan brand can be used across web.

MonPlan currently has 3 acceptable forms of capitalisation that are acceptable, and depend on the situation in which you are presenting.

#### MonPlan

This is our primary form. It should be used in professional communication and materials.

#### monPlan

This is the current form we use in our course planning application. This is because the unnatural capitalisation creates a 'casual, friendly' feeling, which better appeals to the primary audience: Monash University students.

_In future this will be updated to our primary form, MonPlan_

#### MONPLAN

This final form should only be used in captions and bylines. This is because it mirrors our [logo](?a=monplan-black). It should **not** be used in larger bodies of text.

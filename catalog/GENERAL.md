The tagline represents what MonPlan is and shows the exciting factor of the tool being be built by the students.

Some pre-approved taglines include:

The 'for students, by students' is a key here as it helps drive the Student Innovation Program being developed. 

While 'The Monash Course Planner' helps promote us as **the** course planning tool for Monash Students.

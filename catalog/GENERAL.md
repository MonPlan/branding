## Tone of Voice

Please remember when developing frontend interfaces for MonPlan that you are also by extension representing Monash University.

If you need to formulate larger bodies of text, such as in social media communications or an 'About Us' section, try to write with the 3 principles of the Monash 'Tone of Voice' in mind.

#### Genuine

You should strive to be 'down to earth' in your writings. You are comfortable and accessible in your communications, but remain focused no matter the situation.

#### Driven

You are continually pushing yourself and the MonPlan brand to be better. You should strive to innovate and encourage success in the student body who use our application.

#### Optimistic

Finally, you are excited to be contributing to MonPlan! You believe in making a positive impact for users through your actions with MonPlan, and instill them with enthusiasm through your contact.

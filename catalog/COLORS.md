## Primary Colors

This should be the color selection you should use in most cases. It is based around our 'MonPlan' blue.

```color-palette
colors:
  - {name: "300", value: "#2682B8"}
  - {name: "monPlan Blue (500)", value: "#006CAB"}
  - {name: "700", value: "#00599A"}
```

In addition, you may find it relevant to use the Monash University Blue. Please ensure you are aware of and are following their branding guidelines.

```color
value: '#006DAE'
name: 'Monash University Blue'
span: 1
```

## Secondary

When components or elements should rank visibly lower in a heirarchy of importance, this color selection can be substituted for the primary color scheme.

```color-palette
colors:
  - {name: "300", value: "#898989"}
  - {name: "monPlan Gray (500)", value: "#565656"}
  - {name: "700", value: "#454545"}
```

## Errors

This is used when a component should be in an errored state or there are conflicts within a course plan.

```color-palette
colors:
  - {name: "300", value: "#E57373"}
  - {name: "monPlan Error Red (500)", value: "#F44336"}
  - {name: "700", value: "#D32F2F"}
```

## Other Colors

These are a collection of other colors that pop up throughout our application, often for a single purpose.

```color

name: 'Footer Background'
span: 1
```

```color
value: '#C3185A'
name: 'Attention Banner'
span: 1
```

```color
value: '#FFB300'
name: 'Beta Yellow'
span: 1
```

```color
value: '#FFFFFF'
name: 'Logo Background'
span: 1
```

## Faculty Colors

These colours should be used only to aid students in identifying a particular faculty when it matters. For example, we currently use it with unit cards in our application, to help general users quickly identify which faculty a unit belongs to. While this is helpful, you should try and minimise your use of this, for the sake of keeping the interface accessible and maintaining visual heirarchy through colors.

_Consider applying opacity to soften the colors_
